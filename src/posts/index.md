We have made this site to direct people to support local and reputable organisations on the Ukrainian border who are providing direct assistance to refugees with food, water, shelter, and border crossing assistance. 

There are many different groups you could donate to on the ground - there are many that are directly funding militia and arms. There are also some far right groups collecting donations. 

The groups below are only for humanitarian aid. They have been collated by our member organisations in Poland, Romania and Hungary who are all working tirelessly to support their Ukrainian neighbours.
